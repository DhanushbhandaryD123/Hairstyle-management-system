GlowUp — Hairstyle & Spa Booking System

GlowUp is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse hairstyles, find nearby salons, and book appointments online.
The backend is built using Django REST Framework, which provides secure APIs for user authentication, hairstyle management, salon listings, and appointment booking. The frontend is developed using React, creating a responsive and modern user interface.
Users can register, log in, explore different hairstyle categories, check salon availability based on their location, and schedule appointments by selecting date and time. They can also view and cancel their bookings.
The system includes an admin panel where salon data, hairstyles, and appointments can be managed easily.
Overall, this project demonstrates full-stack development skills, API integration, authentication handling, geolocation usage, and responsive UI design.
